# Custom Board

This simple custom board (perforated board) connects the Arduino Nano with the stepper motor and LED drivers.
The arduino code is customized for the used pins to control de stepper motors, to provide PWM signal to control the light intensity (and on/off state) and in the future to provide feedback about the position of the motors.
