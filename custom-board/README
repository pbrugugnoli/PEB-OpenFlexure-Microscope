#Custom Board
- This simple custom board (perforated board) connects the Arduino Nano with the stepper motor and LED drivers.
- The arduino code is customized for the used pins to control de stepper motors, to provide PWM signal to control the light intensity (and on/off state) and in the future to provide feedback about the position of the motors.
- The custom made PWM led driver was replace by the small module LDO6AJSA, based on the CN5711 led driver chip - a much simpler and ellegant solution :-)
- The stepper motor drivers (2PH124959A) had their head pins flipped to simplify the installation in the custom board.
